## 1. Overview and headline claims

**Research question.** On the `dampening-analysis` / `r1r2-decoderC-sharpening-eval` branches, the R1+R2 checkpoint is a single network from the simple-dual-regime architecture trained with Rescue 1 (feature-specific `expected_suppress` via `dot(r_l23, q_pred)`) + Rescue 2 (precision-gated feedback via `pi_pred`). The question is whether this network implements **sharpening** (expectation-enhanced representation; ex > unex on decoder accuracy) or **dampening** (expectation-suppressed representation; ex < unex), and whether the answer depends on the assay paradigm or the decoder.

**Headline claims (factual, evidence-backed).**

- **Hybrid regime.** R1+R2 is decoder-robust-sharpening on the paired-fork paradigm (rows 1, 3, 9, 13 of § 6, all ABC > 0) and decoder-robust-dampening on observational matched-probe paradigms (rows 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, all ABC < 0). The paradigm, not the decoder, flips the sign on R1+R2. Confirmed under Dec A′ (13 R1+R2 rows same sign as Dec A) and Dec E (13 R1+R2 rows same sign as Dec A).
- **Dec A vs Dec E dissociation on dampening legacy networks.** Dec E is Dec-A-spec (same arch + LR + 5000 steps) trained post-Stage-2 on the natural HMM stream. On R1+R2 Dec E ≈ Dec A′ (`frac_same_pred = 0.9722`). On a1 and b1 (dampening legacy configs) **Dec A outperforms Dec E by ≈ 23 pp top-1** (0.59 vs 0.35) and Dec E **flips sign vs Dec A** on a1 / b1 HMM C1 (Δ_A = −0.031 / −0.033 → Δ_E = +0.040 / +0.024). See § 9.6. Sources: `results/decoder_e_stratified_eval_{net}.json`, `results/cross_decoder_comprehensive_with_all_decoders.json`.
- **Dec D Kok-style signature on HMS-T native.** Row 12 of the 17-row matrix: five amplitude-sensitive decoders (A, A′, B, C, D-raw, E) all report dampening (Δ = −0.21 to −0.303); shape-normalised **Δ_D-shape = +0.166**. Expectation suppresses net amplitude while sharpening the orientation-pattern shape on the same r_l23. Only row in the 17-row matrix with this divergence. See § 9.5.
- **Dec A → Dec A′ swap.** Retraining Dec A on the stable (post-training) R1+R2 `r_l23` with 50/50 task_state produces **zero Δ-sign flips** across the 13 R1+R2 rows. Max `|Δ_A′ − Δ_A|` = 0.094, median 0.025. The Dec A training-schedule concern does not materially change the 13-row sign pattern. See § 7.
- **Decoder profiles on 17 rows (2026-04-24 matrix).** Dec A `mean|Δ|=0.2056`, never the ABC sign outlier; Dec A′ `mean|Δ|=0.1902` (13 R1+R2 rows, matches Dec A sign on all 13); Dec B `mean|Δ|=0.0485`, outlier in 2/17 rows; Dec C `mean|Δ|=0.0416`, outlier in 4/17 rows; Dec D-raw `mean|Δ|=0.0520`; Dec D-shape `mean|Δ|=0.0585`; Dec E `mean|Δ|=0.1934`, flips Dec A sign on 2 legacy dampening rows (a1, b1 HMM C1). 11 of 17 rows are ABC all-agree. Source: `results/cross_decoder_comprehensive_with_all_decoders.json`.
- **e1 reclassification (2026-04-22 → 2026-04-24).** The 2026-04-22 "decoder-robust sharpening" label on e1 HMM C1 relied on Δ_C = +0.011; the 2026-04-24 rerun gives Δ_C = −0.002 (crossed zero within ±0.03 CPU FP drift envelope). Under the added Dec D / Dec E: A / B / E positive, C / D near zero. e1 is training-regime-dependent, not decoder-robust. See § 9.3b.
- **Dec A vs Dec C agreement on 10k natural HMM.** `frac_same_pred = 0.6691`, mean circular distance 0.43 ch (≈ 2.1°). Dec A top-1 = 0.5413, Dec C top-1 = 0.5345 (both ≈ 19× chance). Source: `/tmp/task25_dec_av_c_summary.json`.

**Non-claims (calibration).** "Zero sign flips" under Dec A → Dec A′ does not validate Dec A as correct; it only means two linear decoders (trained on the same network states under slightly different schedules) give the same sign of Δ on the 13 R1+R2 rows. "Decoder-robust" in this doc means `sign(Δ_A) = sign(Δ_B) = sign(Δ_C)`, no more — Dec A′, Dec D, Dec E do not join the ABC-triple definition, but their per-row signs are recorded alongside and cross-checked against it.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1. Module map

Defined in `src/model/network.py` (`class LaminarV1V2Network` at `:18`). Populations instantiated in `__init__` at `:34-82`:

| Line | Field | Class | Role |
|---:|---|---|---|
| `:34` | `self.l4` | `V1L4Ring` (`src/model/populations.py:21`) | V1 Layer 4 excitatory ring, driven by grating + contrast + adaptation |
| `:35` | `self.pv` | `PVPool` (`:95`) | PV interneuron pool, divisive normalisation |
| `:36` | `self.l23` | `V1L23Ring` (`:179`) | V1 Layer 2/3 excitatory ring — primary readout population |
| `:37` | `self.som` | `SOMRing` (`:290`) | SOM interneurons, feedback-driven subtractive surround |
| `:76-82` | `self.v2_focused`, `self.v2_routine`, `self.v2` | `V2ContextModule` (`src/model/v2_context.py:13`) | V2 GRU + prediction/precision/feedback/VIP heads. Dual instances for per-regime heads (Fix 2, `Network_both`); legacy alias `self.v2 = self.v2_focused`. |
| `:97-99` | `self.alpha_net` | `nn.Linear(2+1, 2)` | Causal E/I gate (Phase 2.4.1) — emits two gains applied to `center_exc` and `som_drive_fb`. Only present when `model_cfg.use_ei_gate=True`; disabled (`false`) in `sweep_rescue_1_2.yaml`. |
| — | `self.feedback_scale` | buffer `[1]` | Warmup multiplier, ramps 0→1 across Stage-2 burn-in. Loaded at `1.0` at inference. |

Ring geometry: `n_orientations = 36` channels, `orientation_range = 180.0°`, `step_deg = 5.0°`.

### 2.2. V2 heads (`src/model/v2_context.py:13-145`)

GRU(input_dim=110, hidden=16). Input is `r_l4 + r_l23_prev + cue + task_state = 36+36+36+2 = 110`. Heads:

| Line | Head | Output | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|
| `:54` | `head_mu` | `[B, N]` → softmax → `mu_pred` (orientation prior) | |
| `:73-74` | `head_feedback_focused`, `head_feedback_routine` | `[B, N]` raw (can be ±) | Per-regime heads; selected via `task_state` gate |
| `:94-95` | `head_pi` | `[B, 1]` → `softplus(·)` clamped at `pi_max=5.0` → `pi_pred` | |
| `:101` | `head_vip` (Rescue 3, not active in R1+R2 yaml) | `[B, N]` | |

### 2.3. Feedback pathway

In `network.py:295-348`:

```
feedback_signal = task_focused * head_feedback_focused(h_v2)
                + task_routine * head_feedback_routine(h_v2)      # [B, N], unclipped
pi_pred_eff    = pi_pred * feedback_scale                         # [B, 1]
precision_gate = pi_pred_eff / pi_max                              # Rescue 2 gating
scaled_fb      = feedback_signal * feedback_scale * precision_gate
center_exc     = relu(+scaled_fb)    # → L2/3 additive excitation  (Dale-E)
som_drive_fb   = relu(-scaled_fb)    # → SOM → L2/3 subtractive     (Dale-I)
```

`feedback_scale` is a learned-schedule buffer; at inference it equals `1.0`.

### 2.4. Key scalar constants (`sweep_rescue_1_2.yaml`)

| Param | Value | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| `tau_l4`, `tau_pv`, `tau_l23`, `tau_som` | 5, 5, 10, 10 | model |
| `sigma_rec` | 15.0° | model |
| `gain_rec` | 0.3 | model |
| `naka_rushton_n`, `c50` | 2.0, 0.3 | model |
| `sigma_ff` | 12.0° | model |
| `v2_hidden_dim` | 16 | model |
| `pi_max` | 5.0 | model |
| `tau_adaptation`, `alpha_adaptation`, `adaptation_clamp` | 200, 0.3, 10.0 | model |
| `feedback_mode` | `emergent` | model |
| `use_ei_gate` | `false` | model — alpha_net **not** wired in R1+R2 |
| `use_precision_gating` | `true` (Rescue 2) | model |

### 2.5. R1 and R2 rescues (vs simple-dual baseline)

- **Rescue 1** — `lambda_expected_suppress = 2.0`, but the loss body was changed from `|r_l23|` to `dot(r_l23, q_pred)` on routine-expected presentations. Source: yaml line `:71`; loss code in `src/training/losses.py`.
- **Rescue 2** — `use_precision_gating = true` (yaml `:38`): `pi_pred` gates feedback strength. Source code path: `network.py:303,316`.
- **Ancillary** — `lambda_state = 1.0` (yaml `:63`, was 0 in plain simple-dual) to re-enable the prior-KL that gives `q_pred` and `pi_pred` meaningful training signal.

No Rescue 3/4/5 is active in R1+R2 (`v2_context.py:101` `head_vip` absent; `deep_template_pop` and shape-matched prediction both off).

### 2.6. Input stream

HMM-march stimulus generator (`src/stimulus/sequences.py:271 HMMSequenceGenerator`). Stimulus sequence builder: `src/training/trainer.py:188 build_stimulus_sequence`.

Per presentation: `steps_on = 12` + `steps_isi = 4` = 16 timesteps; sequence length `= 25` presentations ⇒ 400 timesteps/trial. Default batch size 32. Readout window for all decoding analyses is `t ∈ [9, 11]` within the ON phase (mean over two timesteps late in the grating ON).

Stimulus params: `cue_dim=2`, `n_states=2`, `p_self=0.95`, `p_transition_cw=p_transition_ccw=0.80`, `ambiguous_fraction=0.3`, `ambiguous_offset=15.0°`, `cue_valid_fraction=0.75`, `transition_step=5.0°`.

## 3. Training pipeline

### 3.1. Stage 1 — sensory scaffold (`src/training/stage1_sensory.py:run_stage1`, 2000 Adam steps, lr 1e-3)

- **Trainable**: L2/3 + PV + `loss_fn.orientation_decoder` (i.e. Dec A). Frozen: everything else.
- **Loop** (`:132-163`): random gratings with contrasts in `[0.1, 1.0]`; V1-only forward pass (20 timesteps, no V2/feedback); cross-entropy on `orientation_decoder(r_l23) vs target channel` + `lambda_homeo * homeostasis_penalty`.
- **Critical detail**: decoder is added to the optimiser at construction (`:127-129: all_params = trainable + list(loss_fn.orientation_decoder.parameters())`) and trained at **every** step from 0 to `n_steps`. No burn-in, no ramp, no freeze-until-step-N. Dec A's weights are therefore fit to a **moving target** (early-training L2/3 ≠ late-training L2/3).
- After the loop: `freeze_stage1(net)` (`src/training/trainer.py:31`) freezes L4, PV, and L2/3's `w_som` / `w_pv_l23` gains; `l23.sigma_rec_raw` and `l23.gain_rec_raw` remain trainable for Stage 2. Decoder state-dict saved to `Stage1Result.decoder_state_dict` and transferred into Stage 2 via the shared `loss_fn`.

### 3.2. Stage 2 — V2 + feedback (`src/training/stage2_feedback.py`, 5000 AdamW steps)

- **Param groups** (`src/training/trainer.py:96-162 create_stage2_optimizer`):
  - V2 params (`v2.parameters()` + `v2_routine.parameters()` if present) at `lr_v2 = 3e-4`
  - `l23.sigma_rec_raw`, `l23.gain_rec_raw` at `lr_feedback = 1e-4`
  - `loss_fn.orientation_decoder.parameters()` at `stage1_lr = 1e-3`
  - (Optional) alpha_net, VIP, deep_template_pop, extra readout heads — not active in R1+R2.
- **LR schedule**: linear warmup 500 steps → cosine decay to 0 (`make_warmup_cosine_scheduler` at `trainer.py:169`).
- **Feedback schedule**: burn-in 1000 steps (`feedback_scale = 0`) → ramp 1000 steps (`feedback_scale: 0 → 1`) → full `feedback_scale = 1.0` for the remaining 3000 steps.
- **Decoder freeze in Stage 2**: `stage2_feedback.py:161-165` freezes the decoder iff `train_cfg.freeze_decoder` or `train_cfg.freeze_v2` is `True`. Both default to `False` (`src/config.py:226, 243`). Under `sweep_rescue_1_2.yaml` neither is set, so the decoder **continues to train** across Stage 2 at `stage1_lr = 1e-3`.
- **Losses** (`src/training/losses.py:CompositeLoss`):
  - `lambda_sensory = 1.0` (cross-entropy on `orientation_decoder(r_l23) vs probe channel`, at readout window `[9, 11]`)
  - `lambda_mismatch = 1.0` (BCE via MLP head — only active on routine branch via task routing)
  - `lambda_energy = 1.0` (L1 on `r_l23`)
  - `lambda_state = 1.0` (prior KL on `q_pred` / `pi_pred`)
  - `lambda_expected_suppress = 2.0` (Rescue 1 feature-specific body)
  - All other λ's = 0 in the yaml.
  - **Per-regime task routing** (yaml `:85-103`): `focused → sensory 3.0, energy 1.0, mismatch 0.0`; `routine → sensory 0.3, mismatch 1.0, energy 1.0`.
- **Gradient clip**: `1.0`.
- **Stimulus noise**: `0.25` (pre-Naka-Rushton additive).

### 3.3. Seeds and reproducibility

- Seed `42` for init + training stream (single seed checkpoint).
- `stage2_contrast_range = [0.15, 1.0]`; `ambiguous_fraction = 0.3` applied per trial in the HMM generator.

## 4. Decoders: A / A′ / B / C / D-raw / D-shape / E

Six distinct decoders exist in the project (Dec D has two variants: raw and shape). Only Dec A is part of the trained network. Dec A′ (2026-04-23) and Dec E (2026-04-24) are post-Stage-2 retrains of the Dec A architecture. Dec D (2026-04-24) is a paired-fork neutral localizer (two variants: raw vs shape-normalised). Dec B and Dec C are pre-existing post-hoc tools. All six are applied to the **same** per-trial `r_l23` (one forward pass, multiple readouts) whenever a cross-decoder evaluation is performed.

### 4.1. Taxonomy

| Decoder | Type | Training data | Samples | Sees unexpected in training? | 10k HMM top-1 (R1+R2) | Artefact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| **A** | `Linear(36, 36)` saved with each Stage-1 checkpoint, continued training in Stage 2. | Natural HMM-march `r_l23` during Stage 1 + Stage 2 training (moving target — L2/3 changes every step, cf. `src/training/stage1_sensory.py:127-163`). | All Stage-1 training trials + Stage-2 trials. | Yes — the natural HMM stream contains jumps/ambiguous/task-switch presentations. | **0.5413** | `ckpt['loss_heads']['orientation_decoder']` |
| **A′** | Standalone `Linear(36, 36)` with bias, trained **only after the network was fully trained and frozen**. | `r_l23` streamed through the frozen R1+R2 network. Per step: batch 32 × seq 25 = 800 readouts at `t∈[9,11]`, ambiguous kept in, 50/50 focused/routine task_state. Adam lr 1e-3, 5000 gradient steps, seed 42; val pool seed 1234, ~8k readouts. | 5000 × 800 = 4 000 000 readouts total. | Yes — same stream, but on **stable** (post-training) L2/3. | **0.5486** | `checkpoints/decoder_a_prime.pt` |
| **B** | 5-fold nearest-centroid CV (`src/analysis/decoding.py:46 cross_validated_decoding`; helper in `scripts/cross_decoder_eval.py:189 decB_acc_5fold`). | The same `r_l23` being analysed — no separate training set. | Varies per-assay (set under evaluation). | Inherits exposure from the assay under evaluation. | — (not applicable; CV over analysis set) | — (computed on demand) |
| **C** | Standalone `Linear(36, 36)` with bias. | 100k synthetic orientation-bump patterns: 50k single-orientation σ=3 ch, amplitudes ∈ [0.1, 2.0]; 50k multi-orientation K∈{2,3} with strictly-max amplitude as the label; Gaussian noise σ=0.02. Adam lr 1e-3, batch 256, ≤30 epochs, early-stop patience 3, seed 42. | 100k synthetic. | No — trained on clean synthetic bumps only; never sees network `r_l23` or HMM context. | **0.5345** | `checkpoints/decoder_c.pt` |
| **D-raw** | Standalone `Linear(36, 36)` with bias, **per-ckpt**, FB-ON paired-fork neutral localizer (2026-04-24). | Paired-fork: N_pre ∈ U{4..10} march at 5°/step with random direction; probe rendered at target_ch for both branches; unex sets march_end_ch = target_ch − D_signed_ch (\|D\| ∈ {5..18} ch = 25°–90°). Cue at march expected-next. Focused task_state, contrast U[0.4, 1.0], `feedback_scale = 1.0` throughout. Balanced 900 train + 100 val per (target_ch × branch) cell → 64 800 train + 7 200 val. Adam lr 1e-3 wd=1e-4, CE, early-stop patience 3, max 30 epochs, seed 42. | 64 800 train readouts per net. | Yes — mix of ex/unex paired-fork with FB on. | **0.3634** (R1+R2); paired-fork training distribution is OOD vs 10k HMM eval so absolute number is not comparable with A/A′/C/E. | `checkpoints/decoder_d_fbON_neutral_raw_{r1r2,a1,b1,c1,e1}.pt` |
| **D-shape** | Same arch + protocol as D-raw, trained on `r_l23 / (r_l23.sum(1) + 1e-8)` (shape only). | Same paired-fork pipeline as D-raw. | Same as D-raw. | Yes. | **0.3726** (R1+R2). | `checkpoints/decoder_d_fbON_neutral_shape_{r1r2,a1,b1,c1,e1}.pt` |
| **E** | Standalone `Linear(36, 36)` with bias, **per-ckpt**, Dec-A-spec post-Stage-2 retrain (2026-04-24). | Natural HMM stream through each frozen fully-trained network, HMM's own stochastic `task_state` (Markov `task_p_switch = 0.2` for R1+R2 via yaml; Bernoulli-per-batch for legacy configs where `task_p_switch` is unset). Cue as HMM produces (75% valid). Readout `r_l23[9:11].mean`. Adam lr 1e-3, **no weight decay**, CE, 5000 gradient steps, seed 42; val pool seed 1234. | 5000 gradient steps × 800 readouts = 4 M readouts per net (r1r2, e1 = full 5000; a1 / b1 / c1 = **step-4000 recovered** due to post-training crash — see § 10.6). | Yes — natural HMM stream. | **0.5467** (R1+R2). | `checkpoints/decoder_e_{r1r2,a1,b1,c1,e1}.pt` |

### 4.2. Agreement on the 10k natural-HMM stream (Task #25 design, seed 42, readout window [9,11])

| Pair | `frac_same_pred` | Mean circular distance (ch) |
|---|---:|---:|

```

Dec D-raw / Dec D-shape trained on paired-fork focused-only with FB on; 10k HMM is 50/50 focused/routine + ambiguous — OOD for Dec D, so its 10k top-1 understates its in-distribution performance (see per-net val balanced-acc in § 4.5b). Dec A ≫ Dec E on a1 / b1 by ~23 pp — see § 9 "Dec A vs Dec E dissociation".

### 4.3. Stratified accuracy on 10k natural HMM (Task #25 strata; `pi_q1 = 0.824`, `pi_q3 = 2.362`; jump threshold 30°; pred-err thresholds 5° / 20°; 50/50 focused/routine per batch)

| Stratum | n | Dec A top-1 | Dec A′ top-1 | Dec C top-1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| overall | 10000 | 0.5413 | 0.5486 | 0.5345 |
| ambiguous | 2960 | 0.2578 | 0.2436 | 0.2304 |

| jump | 1355 | 0.7424 | 0.7469 | 0.4236 |

MAE in channels (overall, 10k): Dec A 0.820, Dec A′ 0.790, Dec C 0.862. `within1`: 0.8871 / 0.8960 / 0.8960. Dec A′ has the smallest overall MAE and the highest `within1`.

### 4.4. Cross-decoder bias flags (17-row matrix, `results/cross_decoder_comprehensive_with_all_decoders.json`, 2026-04-24)

- **Dec A**: `mean |Δ| = 0.2056`, `max |Δ| = 0.3871`; never the A/B/C sign-outlier. Always aligns with the 2/3 majority, produces the largest-magnitude Δ in every row (amplifier).
- **Dec A′** (13 R1+R2 rows only): `mean |Δ| = 0.1902`, `max |Δ| = 0.3902`; zero sign flips vs Dec A on the same 13 rows.
- **Dec B**: `mean |Δ| = 0.0485`, `max |Δ| = 0.1434`; outlier in 2 / 17 rows in 2026-04-24 rerun (HMM C2 / HMM C4 on R1+R2). The earlier 2026-04-22 matrix put B outlier on 5 rows; Δ_B drift of ±0.03 reshuffles the borderline cases.
- **Dec C**: `mean |Δ| = 0.0416`, `max |Δ| = 0.1254`; outlier in 4 / 17 rows (c1 legacy; **e1 legacy**; HMS native; HMS-T modified on R1+R2). Smallest-magnitude Δ in most rows. The e1-outlier emergence is the 2026-04-24 reclassification.
- **Dec D-raw**: `mean |Δ| = 0.0520`, `max |Δ| = 0.2308`. Agrees with ABC majority on 10 / 17 rows.
- **Dec D-shape**: `mean |Δ| = 0.0585`, `max |Δ| = 0.1656`. Agrees with ABC majority on 12 / 17 rows. **Only decoder to report Δ > 0 on row 12** (HMS-T native) — Kok-style signature.
- **Dec E**: `mean |Δ| = 0.1934`, `max |Δ| = 0.4359`. Sign-matches Dec A on all 13 R1+R2 rows; flips Dec A sign on 2 legacy rows (a1 + b1 HMM C1) — Dec-A-vs-E dissociation on dampening legacy configs.

### 4.5. Dec C training and validation (`scripts/train_decoder_c.py`; `results/decoder_c_validation.json`)

- **Training**: 100 000 synthetic patterns, 90/10 split. Early-stopped at epoch 29 with `best_val_acc = 0.8145`.
- **Held-out synthetic**: `top-1 = 0.8145` (single-orientation 0.9800; multi-orientation 0.6522). Note: target 0.95 not met (multi-orientation is the hard case).
- **Real-network natural HMM (R1+R2, 3200 readouts, 4 batches × seq 25)**: all-trials `top-1 = 0.5334` / `±1 = 0.8906` / `±2 = 0.9616`; non-ambiguous slice (2235 readouts) `top-1 = 0.6635` / `±1 = 0.9714` / `±2 = 0.9803`.

### 4.5b. Dec D per-net in-distribution val balanced-acc (paired-fork training set)

| Net | D-raw | D-shape |
|---|---:|---:|
| r1r2 | 0.1869 | 0.2147 |
| a1 | 0.9467 | 0.9456 |
| b1 | 0.9215 | 0.9162 |
| c1 | 0.6182 | 0.6550 |
| e1 | 0.5562 | 0.5590 |

Striking asymmetry: on R1+R2 Dec D caps at ~0.20 despite 64.8 k training
samples; on a1 / b1 (dampening configs, weak feedback) it saturates at ~0.92.
On R1+R2 the feedback is strong enough to perturb the bottom-up probe
signature enough that a linear head trained on both ex and unex cannot
reliably recover the probe channel.

### 4.5c. Dec E per-net training (2026-04-24)

| Net | Steps | Dec E val top-1 (own val pool) | Dec A on same val pool | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| r1r2 | 5000 | 0.5546 | 0.5354 | full |
| e1 | 5000 | 0.4899 | 0.5046 | full |
| a1 | 4000 | 0.3643 | 0.5956 | **step-4000 recovered** |
| b1 | 4000 | 0.3623 | 0.5879 | **step-4000 recovered** |
| c1 | 4000 | 0.4388 | 0.4600 | **step-4000 recovered** |

Per-net "Dec A on same val pool" numbers are from each Dec E training JSON's
`compare_decA_orig_on_val_pool` block — Dec A applied to Dec E's val pool
(HMM-stochastic task_state via each yaml's `task_p_switch`). These differ
slightly from Dec A on Dec A′'s val pool (which uses 50/50 task_state: Dec A
= 0.5472 on R1+R2 — see § 4.6) because the val distributions differ.

Recovery notes in § 10.6.

### 4.6. Dec A′ training curve (`results/decoder_a_prime_training.json`; 5000 Adam steps, lr 1e-3, batch 32 × seq 25, seed 42, val seed 1234)

| Step | Train loss | Train acc | Val loss | Val acc |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | — | — | 3.586 | 0.032 |
| 500 | 2.923 | 0.274 | 2.468 | 0.352 |
| 1000 | 2.234 | 0.361 | 2.049 | 0.378 |
| 1500 | 1.926 | 0.404 | 1.822 | 0.439 |
| 2000 | 1.744 | 0.459 | 1.672 | 0.481 |
| 2500 | 1.617 | 0.499 | 1.562 | 0.513 |
| 3000 | 1.520 | 0.522 | 1.476 | 0.530 |
| 3500 | 1.443 | 0.536 | 1.407 | 0.541 |
| 4000 | 1.380 | 0.547 | 1.349 | 0.549 |
| 4500 | 1.326 | 0.553 | 1.301 | 0.551 |
| 5000 | 1.285 | 0.558 | 1.261 | 0.556 |

Comparison at step 5000 on the same val pool: Dec A (original) `val_loss = 1.208`, `val_acc = 0.547`. Dec A′ edges Dec A in accuracy (+0.009 pp) but has slightly higher CE loss (+0.053). Training was run on local CUDA; wall-clock 2214 s (~2.26 steps/s).

## 5. Evaluation paradigms catalogue

Every paradigm below is evaluated on the **same** R1+R2 checkpoint. All use seed 42 and the `[9, 11]` readout window.

### 5.1. Paired HMM-fork paradigms (constructive probe)

- **NEW (`eval_ex_vs_unex_decC.py` → `results/eval_ex_vs_unex_decC.json`)**: 2400 paired ex/unex trials per value of N (where N = number of HMM anchor presentations before the probe), values N=4..15. Shared pre-probe march, probe consistent (ex) or 90° shifted (unex). `pre_probe_max_abs_diff = 0.0` (bit-identical pre-probe). Pooled across N:
  - Dec acc: `ex = 0.7067 ± 0.0093`, `unex = 0.5813 ± 0.0101`, `Δdec = +0.1254`.
  - Net L2/3 `[B, N]` summed: `ex = 4.987 ± 0.012`, `unex = 6.134 ± 0.022`, `Δnet = −1.148`.
  - Peak-at-stim (max of re-centered curve): `ex = 0.7734 ± 0.0031`, `unex = 0.6263 ± 0.0040`, `Δpeak = +0.1470`.
  - FWHM (linear-interp at half-max of re-centered curve): `ex = 28.444° ± 0.098`, `unex = 29.774° ± 0.192`, `ΔFWHM = −1.330°` (ex **narrower** than unex).
- **4-condition `paradigm_readout` paired HMM fork (`r1r2_paradigm_readout.py` → `/tmp/task26_paradigm_R1R2.json`)**: 1000 paired ex/unex trials × 4 conditions (focused/routine × HMM cue / zero neutral cue), same paired-fork mechanism. Δ from branches:

| Condition | n per branch | Δ_A | Δ_B | Δ_C | Peak Δ (ex−unex) | Net-L2/3 Δ (ex−unex) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C1 focused + HMM cue | 1000 | +0.3090 | +0.0150 | +0.0500 | +0.0680 | −0.6832 |
| C2 routine + HMM cue | 1000 | +0.1580 | −0.0170 | +0.0060 | +0.0581 | −0.1876 |
| C3 focused + zero cue | 1000 | +0.3000 | −0.0070 | +0.0380 | +0.1076 | −0.5722 |
| C4 routine + zero cue | 1000 | +0.1550 | −0.0360 | +0.0390 | +0.0652 | −0.2006 |

FWHM is not reported per-branch in this JSON (the `paradigm_readout` pipeline reports peak and net per-branch; FWHM is in the NEW paired-march eval only).

- **Adjacent-channel signed-offset curve (Task #19, `results/eval_ex_vs_unex_decC_adjacent.json`)**: paired trials re-centered and march-direction-aligned. On expected trials, the `+k` flank (march leading edge) is **lower** than the `−k` flank for k ∈ {1, 2, 3}:

| k | ex at −k | ex at +k | Δ (−k − +k) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 0.7516 | 0.6885 | 0.0631 |
| 2 | 0.6287 | 0.5285 | 0.1002 |
| 3 | 0.4485 | 0.3489 | 0.0996 |

On unexpected trials, the `−k` vs `+k` difference is within ±0.003 at k ∈ {1, 2, 3} (near-symmetric). The asymmetry is observed only on expected trials. The asymmetry itself is an empirical observation; no feedback-ablation or weight-inspection experiment has been run to confirm a mechanism.

### 5.2. Observational matched-probe paradigms (unpaired)

From `scripts/cross_decoder_eval.py` on R1+R2 (`/tmp/task26_xdec_native.json`, CPU, seed 42, n_batches=40, n_trials_per_N=200):

### 5.3. Modified-input (focused + march cue) variants

From `scripts/cross_decoder_eval.py --override-task-cue` on R1+R2 (`/tmp/task26_xdec_modified.json`): pins `task_state=[1,0]` (focused) and replaces cue with deterministic march-continuation bumps (σ=10°).

| Strategy | n_ex | n_unex | Δ_A | Δ_B | Δ_C |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| M3R modified | 3260 | 6486 | −0.1373 | −0.0336 | −0.0176 |

| VCD modified | 6998 | 6998 | −0.0840 | −0.0264 | −0.0130 |

### 5.4. HMM C1 (focused + HMM cue) on legacy reference networks (a1 / b1 / c1 / e1)

From `/tmp/task26_legacy/{a1,b1,c1,e1}_C1.json` (loaded via `MechanismType` shim in `src/config.py:11-25` + `torch.load(..., weights_only=False)` + `strict=False`):

| Network | n_ex | n_unex | Δ_A | Δ_B | Δ_C | Section-5 regime |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| a1 | 1000 | 1000 | −0.0220 | +0.0000 | −0.0090 | Baseline dampening |
| b1 | 1000 | 1000 | −0.0320 | −0.0150 | −0.0230 | Baseline dampening (stronger) |
| c1 | 1000 | 1000 | +0.1870 | +0.0370 | −0.0070 | Transition / mixed |

See § 8 for context on the Section-5 classifications.

## 6. 17-row cross-decoder comprehensive matrix (`results/cross_decoder_comprehensive_with_all_decoders.json`)

Single forward pass per trial; seven readouts per trial (Dec A / Dec A′ / Dec B / Dec C / Dec D-raw / Dec D-shape / Dec E). 2026-04-24 rerun; ABC sign-agreement remains the historical "decoder-robust" filter.

Bolded Δ values flag the two Dec A-vs-E sign-flip rows (5, 6) and the Kok-style sharpening row (12, Δ_D-shape = +0.166 while Δ_A = −0.303).

### 6.2. Per-decoder profile (2026-04-24)

| Decoder | n rows | mean |Δ| | max |Δ| | sign agreement with A/B/C majority |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|

### 6.3. Rows where A / B / C all agree on sign (11 / 17)

| # | Assay | Network | Common sign |

| 17 | VCD-test3 modified | R1+R2 | − |

R1+R2 ABC-robust sharpening rows: 1, 3, 9, 13 (+). R1+R2 ABC-robust dampening rows: 10, 12, 14, 15, 17 (−). Legacy ABC-robust dampening: 5, 6 (a1, b1 HMM C1). Row 3 and row 5 are **new** ALL-agree rows in the 2026-04-24 rerun (Δ_B crossed zero vs the 2026-04-22 values, reflecting ±0.03 CPU FP drift). Row 8 (e1 legacy) — a 2026-04-22 ALL-agree row — is now **C-outlier** in the 2026-04-24 rerun (Δ_C = +0.011 → −0.002; see § 8.3 e1 reclassification).

## 7. Dec A → Dec A′ swap (stable-target sanity check, 2026-04-23)

### 7.1. Motivation

Dec A (`loss_fn.orientation_decoder` in `src/training/stage1_sensory.py:127-163`) is added to the Stage-1 optimiser at step 0 and trained every step through Stage 1 (2000 steps) and Stage 2 (5000 steps, unless `freeze_decoder` is set — not set in R1+R2 yaml). Its weights therefore fit a **moving target**: L2/3 representations change step-by-step as the network learns. Dec A′ is a fresh `Linear(36, 36)` retrained for 5000 Adam steps on `r_l23` streamed through the **fully-trained, frozen** R1+R2 network (net.eval() + `requires_grad_(False)` on every net param, verified by assertion at setup). Question: does the moving-target training for Dec A change the 13-row sign pattern on R1+R2?

### 7.2. Matrix rerun

Patched R1+R2 ckpt (`scripts/_make_decAprime_ckpt.py`): `ckpt['loss_heads']['orientation_decoder']` and `ckpt['decoder_state']` replaced with Dec A′ weights; `ckpt['model_state']` (network weights) untouched. Saved to `/tmp/r1r2_ckpt_decAprime.pt`. Reran the three R1+R2 pipelines (`r1r2_paradigm_readout.py`, `cross_decoder_eval.py` native, `cross_decoder_eval.py --override-task-cue`) against the patched ckpt on CPU, seed 42, identical other args to the original 2026-04-22 invocations. Legacy rows retain their own stored Dec A. Re-aggregated via `aggregate_cross_decoder_matrix.py`. Diff via `diff_decAprime_matrix.py` → `results/cross_decoder_comprehensive_decAprime_diff.{json,md}`.

### 7.3. Per-row Δ_A → Δ_A′ on the 13 R1+R2 rows

- **Zero Δ-sign flips** across all 13 rows. `sign(Δ_A′) = sign(Δ_A)` everywhere.
- `|Δ_A′ − Δ_A|` max = 0.0936 (row 16, HMS-T modified); median 0.0250; mean 0.0316.
- The three largest shifts are sharpening-side rows (HMS-T native +0.081, HMS-T modified +0.094, M3R native +0.061), all toward smaller |Δ|. Dec A′ consistently produces a less-extreme negative Δ than Dec A on sharpening rows, and near-equal Δ on dampening (ex > unex) rows.

### 7.5. Sign-agreement class changes — signal vs noise

Two rows shift their sign-agreement class between the original matrix and the Dec A′ rerun, but both shifts come from Δ_B drift in the rerun, not from the Dec A → Dec A′ swap:

| Row | Assay | Original agreement | Rerun agreement (run-matched Δ_B/Δ_C) | Δ_B orig → rerun |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | HMM C3 (focused + zero cue) | split (A+, B−, C+; outlier B) | ALL-agree (A+, B+, C+) | −0.0070 → +0.0240 |
| 10 | M3R (native) | ALL-agree (A−, B−, C−) | split (A−, B+, C−; outlier B) | −0.0082 → +0.0025 |

Holding Δ_B / Δ_C fixed at their original 2026-04-22 values and only swapping Dec A → Dec A′, **zero rows change sign-agreement class**. The Dec A′ rerun's Δ_B / Δ_C drifted by ≤ 0.03 from the original matrix (same seed, same CPU, residual FP run-to-run noise); Δ_B for rows 3 and 10 crosses zero by ±0.02. The two class changes are therefore attributable to Δ_B noise, not to Dec A′. Source: `results/cross_decoder_comprehensive_decAprime_diff.json`.

### 7.6. Observation (not a claim about correctness)

The 13-row sign pattern — sharpening on rows 1, 9; dampening on rows 10, 12, 14, 15, 17; split on rows 2, 3, 4, 11, 13, 16 — is identical under Dec A and Dec A′. The "moving target during Stage 1" concern for Dec A does not flip any R1+R2 row's Δ sign. This does not validate Dec A as ground truth; it is a consistency check between two linear decoders trained on the same network under slightly different schedules.

## 8. Legacy reference networks (a1 / b1 / c1 / e1)

### 8.1. Section-5 regime classification (RESULTS.md § 5, 25-run parameter sweep)

All legacy runs: `stage1 = 2000 steps`, `stage2 = 5000 steps`, seed 42.

| Run | λ_sensory | λ_energy | l23_energy_weight | M7 (d=10°) | M10 (amplitude ratio) | FWHM Δ (deg) | Regime |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| a1 | 0.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 | −0.047 | 0.70 | −3.9 | Dampening (baseline) |
| b1 | 0.0 | 5.0 | 1.0 | −0.060 | 0.64 | −3.0 | Dampening (stronger) |
| c1 | 0.3 | 2.0 | 5.0 | +0.081 | 0.95 | −4.3 | Transition / mixed |
| e1 | 0.3 | 2.0 | 3.0 | +0.104 | 1.13 | −11.6 | Sharpening (best of 25) |

### 8.2. Three-decoder reproduction on HMM C1 (focused + HMM cue)

From § 5.4 above (same numbers reproduced here for convenience):

| Network | Δ_A | Δ_B | Δ_C | Sign-agreement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| a1 | −0.0220 | +0.0000 | −0.0090 | B outlier (B exactly 0.0; A and C both negative) |
| b1 | −0.0320 | −0.0150 | −0.0230 | ALL agree (dampening) |
| c1 | +0.1870 | +0.0370 | −0.0070 | C outlier (C weakly negative at transition boundary) |
| e1 | +0.2130 | +0.0510 | +0.0110 | ALL agree (sharpening) |

Dec A amplifies the sharpening-vs-dampening gap (`−0.032 → +0.213` across the four networks, range 0.245). All three decoders agree on sign in 2 of 4 rows (b1, e1). Under the looser A-vs-C-only check, 3 of 4 rows agree (a1, b1, e1); only c1 disagrees (c1 sits at the parameter-sweep transition boundary).

The legacy Section-5 regime classifications (a1, b1 dampening; e1 sharpening) reproduce under Dec C on those same three networks. R1+R2 on the same HMM C1 assay (row 1 of § 6) gives `Δ_A = +0.309, Δ_B = +0.015, Δ_C = +0.050`, all three positive — anchoring R1+R2 to the sharpening side **on this assay** (paradigm-dependent, see § 9).

## 9. Robust findings synthesis (2026-04-24)

"Decoder-robust" in this doc means all three decoders (A, B, C) agree on the sign of Δ = acc(ex) − acc(unex). Only the all-agree subset is listed as decoder-robust below. Numbers in this section come from the 2026-04-24 rerun.

### 9.1. Decoder-robust sharpening on R1+R2 (Δ > 0 on A, B, C)

| # | Assay | Δ_A | Δ_B | Δ_C |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | HMM C1 (focused + HMM cue) | +0.3150 | +0.0200 | +0.0660 |
| 3 | HMM C3 (focused + zero cue) | +0.3120 | +0.0140 | +0.0410 |
| 9 | NEW (paired march) | +0.3871 | +0.0854 | +0.1254 |
| 13 | P3P (n = 39/branch, small) | +0.3846 | +0.0286 | +0.0513 |

### 9.2. Decoder-robust dampening (Δ < 0 on A, B, C)

| # | Network / assay | Δ_A | Δ_B | Δ_C |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 5 | a1 legacy HMM C1 | −0.0310 | −0.0060 | −0.0100 |
| 6 | b1 legacy HMM C1 | −0.0330 | −0.0230 | −0.0280 |
| 10 | R1+R2 M3R | −0.1548 | −0.0105 | −0.0274 |
| 12 | R1+R2 HMS-T | −0.3033 | −0.1434 | −0.0779 |
| 14 | R1+R2 VCD-test3 | −0.1666 | −0.0812 | −0.0708 |
| 15 | R1+R2 M3R modified | −0.1362 | −0.0372 | −0.0197 |
| 17 | R1+R2 VCD-test3 modified | −0.0836 | −0.0285 | −0.0103 |

### 9.3. Decoder-dependent on R1+R2 or legacy (≥ one of A / B / C disagrees on sign)

| # | Assay | Δ_A | Δ_B | Δ_C | Outlier |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2 | HMM C2 (routine + HMM cue) | +0.1620 | −0.0340 | +0.0290 | B |
| 4 | HMM C4 (routine + zero cue) | +0.1700 | −0.0230 | +0.0360 | B |
| 7 | c1 legacy HMM C1 | +0.1770 | +0.0200 | −0.0090 | C |
| 8 | **e1 legacy HMM C1** (RE-CLASSIFIED) | +0.1990 | +0.0410 | −0.0020 | C |
| 11 | R1+R2 HMS | −0.1865 | −0.1113 | +0.0525 | C |
| 16 | R1+R2 HMS-T modified | −0.2937 | −0.1169 | +0.0510 | C |

### 9.3b. e1 reclassification (2026-04-22 → 2026-04-24)

Row 8 (e1 legacy HMM C1) was labelled "ALL-agree sharpening" in the 2026-04-22 matrix based on Δ_A = +0.213, Δ_B = +0.051, **Δ_C = +0.011**. The 2026-04-24 rerun gives Δ_A = +0.199, Δ_B = +0.041, **Δ_C = −0.002** — Δ_C crosses zero within the ±0.03 CPU FP drift envelope noted for the Dec A′ and Dec D reruns. With Dec C flipped negative, e1 HMM C1 is **C-outlier**, not ALL-agree, in the 2026-04-24 matrix.

The new 2026-04-24 decoder axes split further:

| Net / Assay | Δ_A | Δ_A′ | Δ_B | Δ_C | Δ_D-raw | Δ_D-shape | Δ_E |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| e1 HMM C1 | +0.1990 | — | +0.0410 | −0.0020 | −0.0050 | +0.0080 | +0.2300 |

Dec A / Dec B / Dec E all strongly positive (sharpening signature); Dec C / Dec D-raw / Dec D-shape near zero or slightly negative. e1's sharpening label is **training-regime-dependent**, not decoder-robust. Decoders that have been exposed to e1's own Stage-1/Stage-2 `r_l23` (Dec A) or trained afresh on e1's natural-HMM post-Stage-2 stream (Dec E) report positive Δ; decoders trained on synthetic bumps (Dec C) or on a neutral FB-ON paired-fork distribution (Dec D) report near-zero Δ.

### 9.4. Hybrid regime claim (holds under all added decoder axes)

On the **paired-fork paradigm** (constructive probe, bit-identical pre-probe), R1+R2 is decoder-robust sharpening (rows 1, 3, 9, 13). On **observational matched-probe paradigms** (M3R, HMS-T, VCD and the focused+march-cue modified variants), the same R1+R2 checkpoint is decoder-robust dampening (rows 10, 12, 14, 15, 17). The paradigm choice, not the decoder choice, drives the sign. The Dec A → Dec A′ sanity check (§ 7) and the Dec A → Dec E comparison (§ 9.6) do not change this: all 13 R1+R2 rows retain the same sign under Dec A′ and under Dec E.

### 9.5. Dec D Kok-style shape-sharpening-under-amplitude-dampening (row 12, HMS-T native on R1+R2)

Same r_l23 across seven decoders: Δ_A = −0.303, Δ_A′ = −0.211, Δ_B = −0.143, Δ_C = −0.078, Δ_D-raw = −0.053, Δ_E = −0.207 (six-decoder all-agree dampening) — but **Δ_D-shape = +0.166**. The amplitude-sensitive decoders (A, A′, B, C, D-raw, E) all report ex < unex; the shape-normalised D-shape reports ex > unex on the same r_l23. This is the Kok-framework co-occurrence: expectation suppresses net L2/3 amplitude while sharpening the orientation-pattern shape at the expected channel. No other row in the 17-row matrix shows this divergence at material magnitude.

### 9.6. Dec A vs Dec E dissociation on dampening legacy networks

Dec E is Dec-A-spec (same architecture, same LR, 5000 gradient steps, seed 42), but trained **post-Stage-2** on the natural HMM stream with the HMM's own stochastic task_state. On R1+R2 Dec E is effectively isomorphic to Dec A′ (`frac_same_pred = 0.9722`). Per-net top-1 on 10k natural HMM (Task #25 design, seed 42):

| Net | Dec A | Dec E | Δ (A − E) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| r1r2 | 0.5413 | 0.5467 | −0.005 |
| a1 | 0.5907 | 0.3542 | **+0.236** |
| b1 | 0.5830 | 0.3507 | **+0.232** |
| c1 | 0.4476 | 0.4257 | +0.022 |
| e1 | 0.4887 | 0.4778 | +0.011 |

Dec A outperforms Dec E by ≈ 23 percentage points on a1 and b1 — the two dampening legacy configs. On these same two rows of the 17-row matrix, Dec E **flips sign vs Dec A** (Δ_A = −0.031 → Δ_E = +0.040 on a1; Δ_A = −0.033 → Δ_E = +0.024 on b1). Every other decoder in the 17-row matrix (A, A′, B, C, D-raw, D-shape) reports negative Δ on these two rows — Dec E is the lone positive.

Interpretation-free consequence: on the dampening legacy networks, the co-trained Dec A captures a representational structure that 5000 steps of post-Stage-2 natural-HMM training cannot reproduce. The Δ_A sign on a1 and b1 HMM C1 is training-regime-dependent.

### 9.5. FWHM-sign reversal between two paired-fork variants

On the 4-condition paired HMM fork (`r1r2_paradigm_readout.py`), FWHM is not reported per-branch. On the NEW paired-march eval (`eval_ex_vs_unex_decC.py`), ex FWHM = 28.444° ± 0.098 is **narrower** than unex FWHM = 29.774° ± 0.192 (Δ = −1.330°). Both paradigms share the paired-fork structure; only the decoding sign (Δ_C > 0 on both) is consistent across the two variants. Peak Δ (ex > unex) and net-L2/3 Δ (ex < unex) are also consistent between them. FWHM per-branch in the `paradigm_readout` 4-condition sweep is not in the JSON used here.

### 10.6. Known discrepancies to watch for

- The 2026-04-22, 2026-04-23 (Dec A′) and 2026-04-24 (Dec D / Dec E) reruns all used the same seed / scripts / CPU device, but Δ_B / Δ_C still drift by ≤ 0.03 row-to-row (residual FP noise). Treat sign-agreement class changes between runs as noise unless Δ_B / Δ_C differ by more than ≈ 0.03. The e1 HMM C1 reclassification (row 8: 2026-04-22 "ALL-agree sharpening" → 2026-04-24 "C-outlier") is a direct consequence of this drift: Δ_C went +0.011 → −0.002.
- Dec B is computed from the same `r_l23` as the assay under analysis (CV within assay). Sample size matters: row 13 (P3P) has n = 39 / branch, so borderline sign calls on P3P are consistent with the small-n noise floor.
- Dec A was continuously trained across Stage 2 under `sweep_rescue_1_2.yaml` (neither `freeze_decoder` nor `freeze_v2` is set). This is consistent with the "moving target" framing, but note that Stage-2 L2/3 is less volatile than Stage-1 L2/3 because `sigma_rec_raw` / `gain_rec_raw` are the only L2/3 params still trainable in Stage 2.
- **Dec E a1 / b1 / c1 are step-4000-recovered, not step-5000** (r1r2 and e1 are full step-5000). A post-training Dec A comparison bug (legacy ckpts lack `ckpt['loss_heads']`, trainer was reading that key unconditionally) crashed the three legacy runs AFTER training completed but BEFORE the final `torch.save`. Crash-safety snapshots at step 4000 were promoted to final; val_acc deltas step 4000 → step 5000 on the comparable r1r2 and e1 runs were ≤ 0.02, so the recovered ckpts are within ~2 pp of the full-budget projection. The trainer has been patched (save-before-compare + `decoder_state` fallback; this will not reoccur). Each recovered ckpt carries `early_terminated_at_step_4000_due_to_crash: true` in its state_dict, and the per-net JSON (`results/decoder_e_training_{a1,b1,c1}.json`) flags the same.
- **Dec D 10k natural HMM top-1 is NOT directly comparable** with Dec A / A′ / C / E on the 10k stream. Dec D is trained on a focused-only paired-fork distribution; the 10k HMM eval uses 50/50 focused/routine + 30% ambiguous — that is out-of-distribution for Dec D. Use Dec D's in-distribution val balanced-acc (per-net, in `results/decoder_d_fbON_neutral_{net}.json`) for comparisons on its native distribution. The 17-row matrix Δ_D-raw / Δ_D-shape values ARE directly comparable with the other decoders because they evaluate on the same per-assay `r_l23` as A / B / C.
